<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

After years of experience in the Sustainability field, I decided to follow a passion that I had only cultivated as a hobby before: programming. <br>So I started it from scratch and I enrolled in a full-time Front End Development Advanced Training Course. As of today, I am looking for a reality that could help me gain experience and enter the programming working field. For my part, I would bring the competence and knowledge I acquired during the course, as well as the experience in a big company I acquired in my previous working experience.
